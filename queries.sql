/* Comments about the efficiency of this query:
The response time (Duration/Fetch) is under 0.1 seconds for all the actions, hence the system reaction is
almost instantaously and there is no need for feedback. The query is optimized as well as possible because
MySQL can use indexes on columns more efficiently if they are declared as the same type and size. As it shows
in column key_len, all tables have the same length. The rows column in the output from EXPLAIN is an educated
guess from the MySQL join optimizer. The estimated number of rows is 1 for all the queries, which means that
the number of rows read to find the occurance matching a certain item is minimized. We also have a variey of
possible_keys evaluated.
